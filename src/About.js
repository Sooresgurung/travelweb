            The term "Trekking Peak" is a commonly misunderstood colloquial term which may refer to a variety of types of peaks in the Himalayan Region. The term is most often associated with
             Group "B" NMA Climbing Peaks classified by the Nepal Mountaineering Association or easier.[1] Some may use the term "Trekking Peak" to solely describe peaks requiring little to no
             technical climbing experience. Others may use the term to describe all mountains regulated by the Nepal Mountaineering Association including Group "A" NMA Expedition Peaks which
              may require considerable difficulties and technical climbing skill.[2]
              Because of the term's loose classification of peaks it can be misleading, encompassing peaks of significant varying difficulties.[1] There is less general consensus for the use of 
              the term in this context of Group "A" NMA Expedition Peaks.
